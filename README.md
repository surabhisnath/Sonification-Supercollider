# Sonification Supercollider

What is Sonification: Sonification is a process and field of study wherein data is represented through sound. As visual graphs, charts are a common way for expressing data, similarly, sound can also act as an affective mode of communicating data.

Advantages: Large, detailed data can often not be represents through visual strategies and sonification comes in very useful here.

Aim: To represent chronological and spatial data through sound

We plan to work on the following:

1) Twelve year data (2001 - 2012) of increase in crime against women in Indian States 
2) EEG signal data from 20 persons for 9 different emotions collected from 90 spatially organized electrodes
3) Mapping different positions of 3D objects in real time
